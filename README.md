Hi, I'm Ratik, a sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Statistics & Computer Science. I am passionate about quantitative development, low-latency systems, and high-performance computing. My primary language is C++, and I am also proficient in Python and R. I am particularly interested in software engineering roles at trading firms, where performance, optimization, and precision are critical. I am currently seeking Summer 2026 internship opportunities.
